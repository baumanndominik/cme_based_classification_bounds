# Frequentist bounds for multi-class classification 

This repository contains an algorithm for multi-class classification that includes frequentist uncertainty intervals. As an example, we here apply the algorithm to the MNIST dataset. A description of the method can be found in:

* Dominik Baumann and Thomas B. Sch√∂n, "Safe reinforcement learning in uncertain contexts," IEEE Transactions on Robotics, 2024, [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05876).

## Requirements

Code was developed using Python 3.8.10. The following libraries are required:

* numpy (developed with version 1.21.0)
* scikit-learn (developed with version 1.0.2)
* torchvision (developed with version 0.7.0)
* matplotlib (developed with version 3.3.4)

## Execution

To execute the code, run

```
python main.py
```
